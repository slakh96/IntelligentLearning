                <p>
                    I'm a strong 4th year student at the University of Toronto's Computer Science department. After spending over 2 
                    years teaching various students fundamental JavaScript concepts, I've realized that my passion is to help new 
                    students gain an interest in web development.

                <p>
                    Having worked as a Teaching Assistance at UofT for over 2 years, I've gained significant experience helping students 
                    understand even the most difficult concepts. Furthermore, I've volunteered as a tutor to help various young children 
                    in underdeveloped countries learning the basics of web programming. My strong experience coupled with my passion for 
                    teaching makes me an excellent candidate to be a tutor.

                    I was tutored by Jack for CSC309 several times. He had a strong grasp of JavaScript's fundamental concepts 
                    and he was able to clearly explain even the most difficult of concepts. He clearly had a strong interest in 
                    teaching JavaScript and it was evident that this interest was backed by various years of experience. I would 
                    recommend Jack for any CSC309 student.

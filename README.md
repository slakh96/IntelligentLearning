NOTE: For optimal viewing experience, we highly recommend maximizing your window/screen.  

Welcome to our web app! You may launch the web app by opening index.html on any browser (Google Chrome recommended). Upon launching the page, you will see our landing page. This page will give you various options - and each one will redirect you to a different page: 
	1) If you click on the "Why Us?" button, you will be transferred to a page that shows you various reasons why Intelligent Learning is an excellent choice.
	2) If you click on the "Accounts" button, you will be redirected to a page that gives you the option to choose between using a Tutor/Tutee acount and an administrator account. The differences between these two types of accounts are clearly explained on this page. If you wish to use a Tutor/Tutee account, you may click on the first button - this will allow you to fill out a simple form and create a new Tutor/Tutee account. If you instead wish to use an adminstrator account, you may click the second button, which will redirect you to our "Careers" page. This page will display our various positions open - and if you are selected for any of those positions, you may become an admin. 
	3) If you click on the "Help" page (3rd option at the top bar), you will be redirected to a new page that contains various frequently asked questions and their respective answers. This page is useful for new users as they can find answers to common questions. 
	4) If you click on the "Sign Up" page, you will be redirected to a page that contains a simple form you can fill out in order to create a new account. This page will require you to enter some personal details, such as first/last names, username, password, and email. Upon entering this information, you will be able to create an account! 
	5) Finally, the last option on the top bar is the "Login" button. If you click this button, you will be transferred to a user authentication page. This page will allow you to enter your username and password. Currently, you must enter "user" for both fields in order for the authentication to be successful (notice that any other inputs will be rejected). Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the main/home page. 

At the main/home page, you will notice a profile box containing the user's image, name, subjects taught, subjects learning, and rating out of 5 stars. To the right, you will notice a large feed section. This section will display all the latest updates - including posts made by other users. At the top of this section, there is an input box that allows you to create a new post. You may enter a course number and a description in order to create a brand new post. Now, notice that at the top bar, there are 4 buttons: settings, help, search, and sign out. Let us discuss all of these in more details: 
	1) If you click on the first button (settings), you will be redirected to a new page. This new page will contain various textboxes to allow you to change your personal information, such as your name, username, email, password, link to LinkedIn, link to Resume, availability, and experience. You can also choose to receive or not receive notifications at the bottom. 
	2) If you click on the second button (Help), you will be redirected to a new page that contains various frequently asked questions and their respective answers. If you scroll down, you can see various questions that new users may have, and the answers to all of these questions. This feature is useful for new members and/or for anyone who is seeking support. 
	3) If you click on the third button (Search), you will be transferred to a new page that allows you to search for tutors of a particular course. You will notice that there is a textbox where you may enter a course, and a "Search" button. After entering a course and clicking the search button, several results will be displayed near the bottom of the page. For example, if the user enters "CSC309" as the course and clicks the "Search" button, they will find various tutors who are currently available to tutor CSC309. 
	4) Finally, if you click on the fourth button (Sign Out), you will be transferred to the initial page. 

At the main page, the user can also view and create new posts. The posts can be about certain courses or upcoming tests for which a user is seeking a tutor. The main feed will be appearing from various sources, although this backend functionality will be implemented in Phase 2. There is a major difference in this view - based on whether the logged in user is an admin or a normal user. For normal users (i.e. tutors and tutees), they can simply view posts. For admins, however, there is extra functionality and rights. The admins can remove certain posts and block certain users - if the posts are deemed rude or explicit, or if the post appear to use inflammatory language. We strongly believe in equality among all our users and among the community of members, and the admins will therefore not tolerate any inflammatory posts. 

In addition, there is also a profile page section. On the main/home page, if you click on the image of the currently-logged in user, you will be redirected to a profile page that shows all the basic information about the user, including contact info, experience, reviews and a short description of the user. This feature can be used to determine if a tutor is a good fit for a user's studying needs. An admin can use this feature to determine if certain tutors have violated any rules & regulations, and to take action accordingly. 

Admin View: The main/home page is slightly different if the logged in user is an Admin. If the logged-in user is an Admin, they will have access to some extra features, such as the ability to delete a post and the ability to block or suspend a user. Let us now show you the Admin View: 
	- Please click the "Sign Out" button at the top. This will redirect you to the initial page 
	- Click on "Login" once again and enter "admin" for both the username and password fields 
	- Now you will be redirected to the main/home page. This page will look similar to the last time you logged in, however, you will be able to clearly notice the aforementioned extra features and buttons. The complete functionality will be provided in Phase 2, when the group gains access to a server. Also note that no other views need to be different for the admin: the admin can exercise his/her full rights in the homepage itself.
